# electron-remote-control

This is the electron port of my previous project, using a single executable you will be able to control your players across many platforms.
a packaged exe file for windows is available at https://gofile.io/d/SYS55s

## Making your own for other platforms
This app uses electron-forge, check the documentation on building for different platforms. please note that you will have to rebuild robotJS on your system too.
